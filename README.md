# Face-detection

Detect faces from two example pictures (test1.jpn and test2.jpn) and create a square frame around them which is visible on the screen for 5 seconds. It prints out also the numpy array of the detected faces.

The project has been done following the tutorial in a Udemy course which I attended (not available anylonger): "The Python Mega Course 2022: Build 10 Real-World Applications". Images are from my personal database.
